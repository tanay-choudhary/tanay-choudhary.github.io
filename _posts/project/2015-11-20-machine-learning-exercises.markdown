Machine Learning Exercises
-----------------

During the course [EECS 495 - Machine Learning: Foundations, Applications, and Algorithms](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/395-495-36.html), I got to implement some of the most fundamental machine learning concepts on dummy as well as real-life datasets. Click on the links below to see the documentation, code, and data on the following topics:

+ [Basic Numerical Optimization](https://github.com/tanay-bits/ml/tree/newyear/basic%20numerical%20optimization)
+ [Regression](https://github.com/tanay-bits/ml/tree/newyear/regression)
+ [Classification](https://github.com/tanay-bits/ml/tree/newyear/classification)
+ [Automatic Feature Design for Regression](https://github.com/tanay-bits/ml/tree/newyear/automatic%20feature%20design%20for%20regression)
