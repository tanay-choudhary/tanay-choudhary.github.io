Development of a Series Elastic Actuator for Robotic Applications
-----------------

In the summer of 2014, I worked at the Mechatronics Design Lab under the [Cyber-Physical Systems Innovation Hub](https://cps.iith.ac.in/cpsiit/) at IIT Hyderabad. There I designed, fabricated and tested a rotary Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), based on the [design of Eduardo Torres-Jara and Jessica Banks](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/lbr/mars/pubs/asimpleandscalableforceactuator50torresjarabanks.pdf). Advisor: [Prof. R. Prasanth Kumar](https://www.iith.ac.in/~rpkumar/), Associate Professor, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

### Overview

*  Reviewed existing SEA designs and theory, created 3D models of components with simplicity, scalability and low cost in mind
*  Acquired components and fabricated parts using 3D printing as well as conventional machining
*  Integrated the hardware, software and electronics modules to create a working prototype
*  Performed various experiments (force sensing, manual homing, torque control, spring stiffness measurement) and achieved desirable results
*  Incorporating a spring element in the motor actuator design simplifies the force control problem into that of position control, which is easy to achieve with just an encoder
*  SEA also enhances safety, compliance and adaptability over traditional stiff actuators, which could enable more natural interaction with humans
