            <p>I'm Tanay. Originally from New Delhi, I'm currently pursuing an MS in Robotics at Northwestern University. I recently graduated as a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani, India. As an undergraduate, I decided to undertake a number of different projects encompassing robot actuators, medical devices and assistive technology, hoping to find what I like. I was eventually drawn to robotics because of its interdisciplinary and practical nature. (Also, I want to be on the right side of the imminent robot revolution!). Since almost every aspect of robotics is so fascinating, I find myself on the path to becoming a jack of many trades, instead of narrowing down to one subfield. I've developed a strong interest in human-machine interaction, mechatronics, control, and perception.</p>
            
            <p>In my free time, I like to go cycling, stargazing, play ultimate frisbee, cruise around on my skateboard, critique films, explore new music, and plenty of other things depending on who's around and what's happening.</p>
            <p>I'm presently seeking relevant full-time positions. Feel free to contact me if you think I could be a good fit for your organization/project.</p>
