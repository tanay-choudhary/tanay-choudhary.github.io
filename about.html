            <p>Hi, I'm Tanay. I work as a robotics software engineer at <a href="https://robotics.vecna.com/">Vecna Robotics</a>. Originally from New Delhi, I recently graduated from the <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/meet-students/profiles-2015-2016/choudhary-tanay.html">MS in Robotics</a> program at Northwestern University. Earlier, as an undergraduate mechanical engineering student at BITS Pilani Goa, rather disillusioned by traditional MechE courses, I decided to undertake a number of extra-curricular projects encompassing robot actuators, medical devices and assistive technology, hoping to find what I like. I was eventually drawn to robotics because of its interdisciplinary and practical nature. (Also, I want to be on the right side of the imminent robot revolution!). Since almost every aspect of robotics is so fascinating, I find myself on the path to becoming a jack of many trades, instead of narrowing down to one subfield. I've developed a strong interest in human-machine interaction, mechatronics, control, and perception.</p>
            
            <p>In my free time, I like to go cycling, stargazing, play ultimate frisbee, cruise around on my skateboard, critique films, explore new music, and plenty of other things depending on who's around and what's happening. Recently I also got into learning Argentine Tango.</p>
